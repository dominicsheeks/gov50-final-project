## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the opioid crisis - particularly that of my home state, Ohio. One way I could go about this is comparing overdose fatality rates to statistics surrounding the introduction of recovery options: centers opened, harm reduction programs produced, etc. By doing so - even though these programs undoubtedly help a signficant amount of individuals - I would be able to distinguish if these measures have a major statistical effect on decreasing overdose-related deaths relative to the evergrowing distribution of opioids in the U.S. and Ohio in particular.
